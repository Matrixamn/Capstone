<p>The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others via a Shiny app.. </p>
<p><em>Tasks to accomplish</em></p>
<ol><li>Create a data product to show off your prediction algorithm You should create a Shiny app that accepts an n-gram and predicts the next word. </li>
</ol><p><em>Questions to consider</em></p>
<ol><li>What are the most interesting ways you could show off your algorithm?</li>
<li>Are there any data visualizations you think might be helpful (look at the Swiftkey data dashboard if you have it loaded on your phone)?</li>
<li>How should you document the use of your data product (separately from how you created it) so that others can rapidly deploy your algorithm?</li>
</ol><p><em>Tips, tricks, and hints</em></p>
<ol><li>Consider the size of the predictive model you have developed. You may have to sacrifice some accuracy to have a fast enough/small enough model to load into Shiny. <em></em>
