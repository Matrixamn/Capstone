<p>This page shows the instructions and the evaluation rubric for the Final Project. The submission interfaces for both this project and the milestone report are found on the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/dsscapstone-002/human_grading" target="_blank" title="null">Report Submission Page</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong>
</p>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit: </p>
<ol><li>A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.</li>
<li>A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (<a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations" title="Link: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations"></a><a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations"></a><a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations" title="Link: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations">https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations</a>) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.</li>
</ol><p>A key point here is that the predictive model must be small enough to load onto the Shiny server. So pay attention to model size when creating and uploading your model. 

</p>
<p><strong>Part 1. Please submit the URL for your text prediction Shiny app that is running on shinyapps.io and that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?<ul><li>0: No, the link does not lead to a Shiny app with a text input box </li>
<li>1: Yes, the link leads to a Shiny app with a text input box</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?<ul><li>0: No, the app did not load or was not available to accept inputs</li>
<li>1: Yes, the app could accept inputs.</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?<ul><li>0: No, the app did not produce a prediction of a single word</li>
<li>1: Yes, the app did produce a prediction of a single word</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?<ul><li>0: No, the app did not appear to perform sensibly?</li>
<li>1: Yes, the app produced predictions for some words</li>
<li>2: Yes, the app produced a prediction for each word</li>
<li>3: Yes, the app produced predictions for each word and predicted the correct word in at least one case</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Use this space to provide constructive feedback. This is actually the most important evaluation criteria, take this opportunity to help your fellow students improve their work. Point out the submission's strengths and explain how the submission could be improved in the future. You may also use this space to explain any of your grading decisions that require elaboration. (25 word minimum)</li>
</ul><br /><strong>Part 2. Please submit a slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (</strong><span style="font-size:15.3333330154419px;line-height:17px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations" target="" title="Link: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations" style="color:rgb(17,85,204);"><strong>https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations</strong></a></span><strong>) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor. Remember to check to make sure your deck displays if you are not logged into R Pubs.</strong>
<br /><br /><ul><li>Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?<ul><li>0: no, it does not lead to a 5 slide deck</li>
<li>1: yes, it does lead to a 5 slide deck</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?<ul><li>0: no, it does not contain a description of the algorithm</li>
<li>1: yes, it contains a description of the algorithm</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?<ul><li>0: no, it does not describe the app and its function</li>
<li>1: yes, it does describe the app and its function</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>How would you describe the experience of using this app?<ul><li>0: The app was functional and met the description of the project requirements</li>
<li>1: The app was well-designed, easy to use, and generally performed well.</li>
<li>2: The app was was very impressive: designed well, fast and responsive, surprisingly accurate, and a joy to use.</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Use this space to provide constructive feedback. This is actually the most important evaluation criteria, take this opportunity to help your fellow students improve their work. Point out the submission's strengths and explain how the submission could be improved in the future. You may also use this space to explain any of your grading decisions that require elaboration.
</li>
</ul><br /><strong>Part 3. Overall Evaluation</strong>
<br /><br /><ul><li>Here is an opportunity to give this person an +1 for a particularly well-done app or a novel approach.<ul><li>0: the app was adequate, but not particularly novel or well-done.</li>
<li>1: the app presented a novel approach or was particularly well-done.</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?<ul><li>0: No</li>
<li>1: Perhaps. They do good work, but I would need to see more.</li>
<li>2: Yes, they're hired.</li>
</ul></li>
