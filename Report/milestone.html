This page shows the instructions and the evaluation rubric for the Final Project. The submission interfaces for both this project and the milestone report are found on the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/dsscapstone-002/human_grading" target="_blank" title="null">Report Submission Page</a>.
<br /><br /><strong>Preamble</strong>
<br /><br /><p>The goal of this project is just to display that you've gotten used to working with the data and that you are on track to create your prediction algorithm. Please submit a report on R Pubs (http://rpubs.com/) that explains your exploratory analysis and your goals for the eventual app and algorithm. This document should be concise and explain only the major features of the data you have identified and briefly summarize your plans for creating the prediction algorithm and Shiny app in a way that would be understandable to a non-data scientist manager. You should make use of tables and plots to illustrate important summaries of the data set. 
</p>
<p>The motivation for this project is to: 
<br /></p>
<ol><li>Demonstrate that you've downloaded the data and have successfully loaded it in.
</li>
<li>Create a basic report of summary statistics about the data sets.
</li>
<li>Report any interesting findings that you amassed so far.
</li>
<li>Get feedback on your plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app. 
</li>
</ol><br /><strong>Please upload the URL of an R Pubs document describing your exploratory analysis (http://rpubs.com/, be sure that the url that you submit is http and not https). </strong>
<br /><br /><ul><li>Does the link lead to an HTML page describing the exploratory analysis of the training data set? 
<ul><li>0: no, the link does not lead to a document describing the exploratory analysis
</li>
<li>1: yes, the link does not lead to a document describing the exploratory analysis
</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Has the data scientist done basic summaries of the three files? Word counts, line counts and basic data tables?
<ul><li>0: no, the data scientist has not evaluated basic summaries of the data such as word and line counts
</li>
<li>1: yes, the data scientist has evaluated basic summaries of the data such as word and line counts
</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Has the data scientist made basic plots, such as histograms to illustrate features of the data?
<ul><li>0: no, the data scientist has not made basic plots, such as histograms to illustrate features of the data
</li>
<li>1: yes, the data scientist has made basic plots, such as histograms to illustrate features of the data
</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>Was the report written in a brief, concise style, in a way that a non-data scientist manager could appreciate?
<ul><li>0: no, the report is not brief and concise and can not be understood by a non data scientist
</li>
<li>1: yes, the report is brief and and concise, but could not be understoodd by a non data scientist
</li>
<li>2: yes, the report could be understood by a non data scientist, but is not brief and concise
</li>
<li>3: yes, the report could be understood by a non data scientist and is brief and concise
</li>
</ul><br /></li>
<li>An important part of being a data scientist is being able to provide your colleagues with constructive feedback that they can then use to improve their own work. This is the most important evaluation criteria. In the space below, we want you to do just that. Give the data scientist good, useful, and actionable feedback about the strengths of their work and the areas that need improvement. Give them advice about what they can do to take their work to the next level. (25 word minimum)</li>
